Problem: Can not get the text for the classes information to move to the left of the div.

Solution: Created 2 columns, one for the image and class name, and one for the paragraph about the class. Added a class and some padding to each paragraph
and seems to be working fine now.

Problem: Can not get the paragraph to move down underneath the opening times and contact information.

Solution: Needed to hard reset. Did not know this was a thing until now. Will be quite useful.
